Experiment on how to implement plugins in C++

DONE
 - Linked Boost system static in one library and dynamic in the other


TODO
 - Try cross-compiling with msvc (different versions?) and mingw
   They cam be built on separate machines and run on one
 - Try with different runtimes all at the same time (from even different compilers)
